This repository calculates the Drag of an airfoil from a windtunnel test based on the raw data received.

It is still erroneous: My best bet is that the error lies in the expansion of the static pressure rake since there is a different amount of these than the total pressure rake.

In the excel file these two rakes are colour coded to see where the static pressures are duplicated.
